Action Network Templates

These are template files for Action Network Partners. These files are designed for us in the UK with GDPR settings turned on and include a "Are you sure" prompt when user's select no on the email optout.

To use the files you need to crate a scss file user the "master-style" template from which you can generate the css using a SASS compiler. 

Use the header and footer files adding your logo and copy for the "are you sure" box and footer to customise. Fundraising pages need a separate footer as the "skip to action" button is not required on donation pages.

These templates are maintained by Small Axe (thesmallaxe.org) for the community.
